“I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.”  

― Ralph Waldo Emerson

I like remembering things :).
So I keep track of what I eat using <a href="https://cronometer.com/">Cronometer</a> and take notes about the books I read using <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/44243874-goktug-yilmaz?order=d&shelf=read&sort=date_read">Goodreads</a>. Unlike book summaries or reviews these are just some interesting things that I learned which I would like to read again from time to time. I review all my notes yearly.
