| ------------- |:-------------:|

You need to make a choice, do you abandon science to preserve your heart, or abandon your heart and sacrifice yourself to science?|Lloyd Asplund
The people who don't like what they've got are the same people who invent things, and make discoveries, and advance civilization. They made airplanes 'cause they wanted to fly, and they made cars and trains because they wanted to go from place to place. It's as simple as that. The only reason that we've got all the things we have now is because a certain group of people got together and used their talent or imagination or genius or whatever to make it all possible. Ordinary people are probably better off living their ordinary little lives in an ordinary manner.|Kyon
There's no such thing as love. It's just a pathetic notion that you lesser life forms cling to so you don't feel so alone.|Emperor Zing

Scientists have been trying to find it for hundreds of years, pouring tons of money into research, and to this day they don't have a theory. For that matter, the elements found in a human being is all junk that you can buy in any market with a child's allowence. Humans are pretty cheaply made.|Edward Elric
People can say there is a balance, a logic that everything happens for a reason... But the truth is far less designed. No matter how hard you work, when you die, you die. Some spend their entire life trying to scratch their way to the top, and still die in poverty. While others are born into wealth without ever working at all. It's a cruel and random world. And yet the chaos is all so beautiful.|Dante
I just find phones distracting. I can't stand when people's cell phones are ringing when I'm trying to talk.|L
However gifted you are, you alone can't change the world.|L
This world is rotten, and those who are making it rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it. Because the world... can't go on like this. I wonder... what if someone else had picked up this notebook? Is there anyone out there other than me who'd be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it: there's no one. But I can do it.
