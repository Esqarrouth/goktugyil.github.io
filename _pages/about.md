#### EasyUO Scripts

<a class="github-button" href="http://www.easyuo.com/psl.php?page=mypsl&scripter=Esqarrouth" aria-label="EasyUO"> EasyUO </a>

- To stay competitive in the MMORPG Ultima Online I've spent years building some of the most popular character automation tools.
- I only officially open sourced 4 of my work in the field. I have more than 50 more scripts like these.
- I shared a lot of the private scripts with a few guild members which ended up getting passed around through word of mouth and ended up in hundreds of thousands of players libraries and websites.
- I've later heard that some groups used my tools for farming items and selling them for more than $500K profits. 
- My proudest economy automation was creating a spell scroll factory inside the game that required at least 5 other players to open 4 characters each. We used this method to become the richest guild in 3 months in the server UODemise (6 year server at the time). My system generated so much money that we experienced the effects of inflation. Every item in the game doubled in price. We owned the economy, we owned the game world.
- My produest pvp automation was creating the perfect pvp mage that could take out the best 20 ping mages in the world with 300 ping connection.

- This was the first large project where I contributed for years and saw my contributions having an effect on thousands of people.
- There were hundreds of contributors at its peak days
- The original code used SVN instead of git
- RunUO is no longer officially supported by a core team. And the project forked into a new one called ServUO
