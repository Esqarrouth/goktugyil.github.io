#### EasyUO Scripts

<a class="github-button" href="http://www.easyuo.com/psl.php?page=mypsl&scripter=Esqarrouth" aria-label="EasyUO"> EasyUO </a>

- To stay competitive in the MMORPG Ultima Online I've built some of the most popular character automation tools.
- I only officially open sourced 4 of my work in the field. I have more than 50 more scripts like these.
- I shared a lot of the private scripts with a few guild members which ended up getting passed around through word of mouth and ended up in hundreds of thousands of players libraries and websites.
- I've later heard that some groups used my tools for farming items and selling them for more than $500K profits. 
- My proudest economy automation was creating a spell scroll factory inside the game that required at least 5 other players to open 4 characters each. We used this method to become the richest guild in 3 months in the server UODemise (6 year server at the time). My system generated so much money that we experienced the effects of inflation. Every item in the game doubled in price. We owned the economy, we owned the game world.
- My produest pvp automation was creating the perfect pvp mage that could take out the best 20 ping mages in the world with 300 ping connection.

‚öîÔ∏è An open source emulator for the MMORPG Ultima ONline

- Unlike other open source projects in here I was merely a contributor in this project
- This was the first large project where I contributed for years and saw my contributions having an effect on thousands of people.
- There were hundreds of contributors at its peak days
- The original code used SVN instead of git
- RunUO is no longer officially supported by a core team. And the project forked into a new one called ServUO

### Games

<hr />

#### Ultima Online

This is my all-time favorite game. A completely open sandbox and very realistic medieval world simulation made this more than a game, it was a world to live in. I've made hundreds of friends & enemies, learned how to code, automate tasks, AI, create and manage a guild, created websites, use the forums, hack Windows, theorycrafting due to UO. 

No other MMORPG achieved to be like UO. If no one else makes a modern version of this game, I'm going to be the one to do it.

<hr />

#### DotA Allstars

This was the game we played when there wasn't much action in UO. Was a brilliant pvp concept, community and the MOBA concept evolved very quickly from the first phases. Played for thousands of hours. Attended some tournaments, had a lot of fun.

<hr />

#### League of Legends

I was getting dragged into LoL every 6 months to play it by my DotA friends. It was improving tremendously fast. After 2 years of trying it and uninstalling, I decided that it to start it for good and played for thousands of hours. I created a school society, eSports teams and achieved rating levels equilevant to chess grandmaster. 

I created a spreadsheet on all the champion stats, did research and discovered the most underused jungler champions that had potential.
I played with the underused champions in a championship which reached 100K live viewers on Twitch. Immediately after, those 3 underused champions became the top pick and bans in all games. Every single player in LoL (20M at the time) was affected and had to change their play style because of my discovery. 
I also popularized minute 5 dragon kills with 7 heroes. I was given the nickname Dragonslayer by commentators and started getting recognized by random 13 year kids in the street.

Here are my top Solo Que Rankings:

- Europe West Server - Diamond League (Top 0.1%)
- Turkey Server - Challenger League (Top 50 - 0.03%)

<hr />

#### Rust

This was the closest modern game to UO that I've played. Complete sandbox, crafting, no rules, trash-talking, guilds, murderers, friends, politics, trade. Its only downsides were being an FPS meant people using aiming scripts and houses that could be raided and every item you farmed just getting stolen from your house while you were asleep. So naturally I found a bug and placed containers that couldn't be stolen from. 

<hr />

#### Age of Empires II

AoE, like UO is a 20 year old game that was created almost perfectly. Luckily it was modernized and we can continue playing it. This is the game with highest amount of skill gap between players in the world. No other balanced game will allow even 1v3 between players. AoE makes it possible to do 1v7 because of the ridiculously high skill cap people can reach.  

I've reached 1850+ rating. Roughly top 1000. But I know one of the elite can beat 3 of me at the same time. 

<hr />

#### Other Games

I've listed the top 5 games I spent my time on. The common theme is everyone of them is an online pvp game that requires a lot of skill and strategy. 

I play single player games too, but can't play as much since single player game contents are always less than multiplayer games. I like the genres: PvP, MMORPG, MOBA, Strategy, Simulation, Survival, Crafting, Sandbox.
