This is the homepage of an imaginary person called John Smith who lives in London, UK. It exists as a demo of the Friday Theme, which is a portfolio and blog theme for Jekyll.

Let's imagine John Smith is a freelance software engineer. He blogs occasionally, maintains some project pages for things he has on GitHub, and has a portfolio of work that he maintains instead of a CV. Friday Theme has layouts and collections for exactly that. This web site is a demo of it in action.
